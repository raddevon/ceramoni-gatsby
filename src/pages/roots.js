            I was 10 when I first listened to stones' message with any real
            consciousness. Ma had taken me to the Rock Extravaganza in
            Georgetown, Texas. I fought the outing until we arrived, and then I
            got very quiet. Ma gifted me a 10-piece mixed pack in a small black
            velvet pouch. These stones were with me every day for many years and
            gifted 1-by-1 April 2018 -April 2021, after an angelite I'd wrapped
            for my Self disappeared. I've learned stones find their way to
            people and places who need them, despite greed, attachment, or
            detainment.

            Bi-religious born, I was very curious about spirituality. I studied
            both Judaism and Christianity and began a formal spiritual journey
            at 15 with a public non-denominational baptism. As an anxious child,
            I found meditation beneficial. This began the recognition of the
            infinite paths to Source. I practice Jewish, Catholic, Christian,
            Islamic, Hindu, Lakota, Taoist and Buddhist traditions. My altar has
            room for all. I listen closely to what the crystals share with me
            and continue to deepen my inner wisdom of stones' recommendations
            for healing use.

            I lived in Istanbul, Turkey, teaching English, 2014-2018. December
            2015, my 108-beaded mala broke. The Islamic prayer beads (misbaha,
            tesbih, sibha) has 99 beads, and at the time wanted to keep with my
            practice of 108 breathes to my inner Buddha. Turkey is along the
            Silk Road, and high quality stones made themselves easily
            identifiable.

            January 28, 2016, my first mala manifested. I used 108 8mm garnet,
            red nylon thread, an almond seed guru w/ wooden fasten, and premade
            cotton tassel. As birthday gift to my Self, I began my journey with
            intentional jewelry.

            It's my incarnation's highest honor, to sit, to listen, to string,
            to help, to give, to play, to pray, and I'm grateful to those that
            have let me share their manifestations.{' '}
